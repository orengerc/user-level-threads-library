FILES:
README - this file.
Makefile - contains the recipe for building the program.
uthreads.cpp - implements the uthreads library.
uthreads_lib.cpp - implements the data structures used in the uthreads library.
uthreads_lib.hpp - declares the data structures used in the uthreads library.

REMARKS:
1)

ANSWERS:
1) User-level threads are small and much faster than kernel level threads. If we want to implement a system that doesn't do alot of I/O operations, 
   but has many different mechanisms running at the same time with the same resources, we would want to use user-level-threading.

5) The sigsetjmp() function saves the environment of the calling thread in its sigjmp_buf env argument. If the value of the savemask argument is not 0, 
   sigsetjmp will also save the current signal mask of the calling thread as part of the calling environment. sigsetjmp() returns 0 when successful, or thread number
   if the return is from a call to siglongjmp(). 
   The siglongjmp() function restores the environment saved by the most recent invocation of sigsetjmp() in the same thread, with the corresponding 
   sigjmp_buf argument. After siglongjmp() is completed, program execution continues as if the corresponding invocation of sigsetjmp() had just
   returned the value specified by the argument val.
